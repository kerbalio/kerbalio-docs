**All modlist updates will be posted by Emlyn in the announcements channel - this is the only official source.**

### Time to enhance your experience! Here's how to update to the latest modlist.

## Easiest method (if you use Modrinth)
Modrinth Install
{: .label .label-green }

By far the easiest thing to do is to download the latest mcpack file from [here.](https://github.com/spacetwitter/spitter-mc/releases/tag/v1.2.x)

**However, this will create a completely new instance. I know this isn't ideal sometimes, so there's another option that lets you keep the same instance and your screenshots etc:**

## Ideal method (Modrinth/Manual Fabric)
Modrinth Install
{: .label .label-green }
Fabric Manual Install
{: .label .label-yellow }


The best way to do this is to download [the zip file here](https://github.com/spacetwitter/spitter-mc/releases/tag/v1.2.x). 

You can safely drag all the jar files into your mods directory, and when Windows asks you whether to keep the duplicates tell it to skip. **If you're confident that you were on the latest update, you can just drag the new mod jar file in.**
