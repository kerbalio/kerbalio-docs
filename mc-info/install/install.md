**To play on the server, you need Minecraft Java Edition and the Fabric Mod Loader to begin with.**

The easiest way to sort out the mod loader is by using the app Modrinth. Modrinth is an app similar to CurseForge, however supports the open-source community better and is generally less annoying and has a much nicer UI. This guide will cover installing the Fabric Mod Loader via Modrinth.

1) Install Modrinth App
Download the app at [https://modrinth.com/app](https://modrinth.com/app). Select the version corresponding to your operating system.

2) Follow installation instructions
It is pretty self-explanatory what to do, first you can create a Modrinth account if you want - this is optional though, but I do recommend it as it syncs your installations between computers.
