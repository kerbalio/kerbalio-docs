{: .warning }
**Make sure you have either completed the modloader setup [on the previous page](https://spitter.space/mc-info/loader-install), or you have a Fabric 1.20.1 profile already setup!**

## Using the Modrinth .mrpack mod installation (Very Easy!)
Modrinth Install
{: .label .label-green }


If you installed Modrinth, it's really easy to get your mods setup. Clicking [this](https://github.com/spacetwitter/spitter-mc/releases/download/v1.2.x/Spitter-Autumn-Fabric-Update1.2.0.1.2.0.mrpack) will download the .mrpack file. 

Then, click the green plus button at the bottom left of your Modrinth App window. Select the "From File" option at the top of the popup and drag and drop or select your .mrpack file you downloaded.

The profile will then install automatically, and you will be able to launch the game from the Modrinth Library page!

So, now you're completely ready to go. Follow [this link to read how to connect to the server!](https://spitter.space/mc-info/connecting)


## Manual install to your mods folder (slightly harder)
Fabric Manual Install
{: .label .label-yellow }


If you installed Fabric manually, all you need to do is to download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/spacetwitter/spitter-mc/releases/download/v1.2.x/spitter-1.2.0.zip).

You then need to extract it using the right click menu in your file manager of choice.

Now, open your profile folder from the Minecraft launcher, and open the Mods folder within. 

Drag or copy the .jar files from the unzipped folder into the mods folder. 

{: .warning }
Do not drag the whole folder itself in, just the .jar files that are inside the folder need to be copied!

Now try launching your Minecraft instance. If it loads and you can see the Mod Menu button and/or the Fabric (x amount of mods) text on the bottom left, you're good to go!
