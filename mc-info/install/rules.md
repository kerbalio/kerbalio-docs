# **Minecraft Server Rules**

**If a player has PVP enabled, feel free to fight them, roleplay, whatever. `Use /pvp to toggle your PvP status.` Otherwise, leave them alone! ** 
### this feature has not been enabled yet, so all pvp is currently disabled.

a) No stealing/griefing. Please try not to decimate *all* the villages. Chests are locked automatically. However, this doesn’t mean you can take from chests that aren’t claimed without permission. Obviously, don’t grief builds.

b) No hacking/xray/baritone. Come on, this is pretty obvious. Other mods like HWYLA and QOL stuff is absolutely fine though 

**PUNISHMENTS**
Chat: 3h -> 12h -> 1-7d mute
Griefing:  3h -> 12h-1d -> 3-7d ban
Cheating: 1d -> 7d -> perma ban
__**You may appeal any punishment by opening a ticket (coming soon) in the discord or messaging an @Event Staff member**__

> **All blocks placed/broken and items transferred are logged and are viewable on request. If you steal, you WILL get caught!**
