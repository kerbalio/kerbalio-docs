**To play on the server, you need Kerbal Space Program (not the console version) and the required mods.**

# If you have any problems, please [join the Kerbal Community Discord.](https://discord.gg/9hgSkqSVQD)

**IMPORTANT: Please replace the Kopernicus folder within the modpack with [this](https://github.com/ballisticfox/Kopernicus/releases) correct one. **

Download and unzip [this folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bept8CVf-JyL03u7kUE9hSZ_0sTrOntg/view?usp=share_link) into your GameData folder....

And also download and copy the [KSRSS textures](https://github.com/ballisticfox/KSP-64k/releases) into your GameData folder as well.


If you've done this correctly when you boot up the game you should see it 1) takes a long time to load and 2) shows a Luna Multiplayer popup window when it loads.

Once you're done installing it and you have tested that the game runs, then move onto the next page: ["How to join the server"](/ksp/join)
