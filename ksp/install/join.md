**Ensure you have completed all the steps before you attempt to connect - you will not be able to see other players otherwise!**

### So, you've come this far. Now, it's time to take the leap into the virtual: joining the server.

## Finding or adding the server

After launching the game with the mods installed, the Luna Multiplayer connection window should open.

Now, you can type in the server IP: `server.kerbal.io`. The connection port can be left as default.

Alternatively, open the server list. You should be able to find the server fairly easily.


# BEFORE YOU JOIN please take a moment to read through our rules. By joining the server, you agree to the rules. 

## Connecting

You can click the `Connect` button, and you should automagically join our little world!

If any of this doesn't work, make sure to give me a ping in the Discord and I'll help you out!
