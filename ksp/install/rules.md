# **KSP Server Rules**

## THE MAIN RULE

No messing around with other people's hard work. This includes touching their ships or stations especially when they aren't online.
If you want to help out with their build, just give them a ping on Discord, and ask! Otherwise, leave them alone.

### Make sure to either have your Discord name as part of your ship name, or to have it visible.


**PUNISHMENTS**
Chat: 3h -> 12h -> 1d mute
Griefing:  3h -> 12h-1d -> 3-7d ban
