# **KSP Server Rules**



1. No messing around with other people's hard work. This includes touching their ships or stations especially when they aren't online. If you want to help out with their build, just give them a ping on Discord, and ask! Otherwise, leave them alone.


2. Inappropriate or offensive images/flags/ship names etc will be punished. This includes symbols or identifying features of proscribed organisations in the UK.


3. Please refrain from conducting "recreations" of divisive geopolitical situations. This is especially the case for sensitive topics like the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You are also not allowed to recreate historical warcrimes or genocides - don't pull a HOI4 people. Additionally, recreating any terrorist attacks is strictly forbidden. **This rule doesn't ban military roleplay, just be mindful what you do and we can all have fun!**


4. Regarding PVP, you are not allowed to randomly shoot at other players - so in effect, "no RDM". If you are at war with another player and/or you are in a PVP area or you have agreed to fight, then it is allowed.


5. When claiming land on planets/Kerbin/Duna/the Mun/whatever, it is first come first served. However, expect to have to defend your claim if other people want to fight you for it.


6. Alliances are permitted. You must not declare war on any neutral players or groups.


7. There are a limited amount of launchsites available to claim by players. You can view who has claimed what in the [launchsites list](/ksp/launchsites). To claim your own, go to the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9coyesKrgOY5VkEyCePyJ91N17FwGxqwbbdgjpVwxw/edit#heading=h.ojmbsbevz73g). 




### Make sure have your callsign prepended to your ship name, or to have it visible. To look up people's callsigns in order to communicate with them eg. over Discord, search for them in [this webpage](/ksp/callsigns). 

If you haven't set your callsign, visit the [planning google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9coyesKrgOY5VkEyCePyJ91N17FwGxqwbbdgjpVwxw/edit#heading=h.fknrhqzh8oki) and enter it in there.



**PUNISHMENTS**
Punishments will be issued on a case by case basis.
